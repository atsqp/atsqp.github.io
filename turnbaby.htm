<br />
I have always been interested in the problem of breech babies,<sup><a href
="#footnote2">2</a></sup>  having been one myself.</p>

<p>
We do not know for certain what causes most babies to settle in the 
head-down position after months of floating and turning in the womb: it 
seems to be a programmed reflex action on the part of the embryo. Although 
at 30 weeks about one fifth of all babies are still in breech position, 
most of them turn spontaneously before birth. Why do some babies (about 
four per cent) persist in the awkward breech position until the very end? 
We do not know the complete answer; in most cases there is no obvious 
reason.
</p>



<p>
As we all know, a breech baby can be born vaginally; but complications may 
occur. Therefore obstetricians often recommend an elective Caesarean 
Section (CS), especially for first-time mothers. Things were very different 
before the advent of antibiotics, when operations were much more risky than 
they are today. My mother told me that when she was about 36 weeks 
pregnant, her obstetrician tried (unsuccessfully) to turn me by external 
manipulation. In recent decades, however, use of this technique (<i>external 
cephalic version</i>) has declined because it may occasionally cause 
complications.
</p>



<p>
I do not wish to discuss the pros and cons of this technique. In any case, 
even where it is still offered, it requires expert skill: the woman cannot 
do it herself. I am interested in procedures that the pregnant woman can be 
taught to apply herself. Later on I shall discuss and describe certain 
movements that may stimulate the baby to turn.
</p>


<p>
Nowadays most expectant mothers undergo several ultrasound examinations 
during the course of their pregnancy. The desirability of these scans 
&#151; as indeed of several other routine obstetric procedures &#151; is 
debatable. A woman may refuse to be scanned routinely, but if the midwife 
or the obstetrician suspect at around 32&#150;36 weeks that her baby lies 
in a breech presentation, they will usually advise her to have this 
confirmed by a scan.
</p>

<p>
Medical staff who provide antenatal care are often insufficiently trained 
in the skills of communication. Pregnant women are very vulnerable and 
sensitive. The last thing a pregnant woman needs is increased anxiety, 
which creates tension. This is bad both for her and for her baby.
</p>

<p>
The following story, written by a mother, illustrates what can be called 
&#145;anxiety-inducing communication&#146;.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#145;At about the 36th week of my first pregnancy I had an ultrasound scan 
which showed that the baby was in breech position. I went immediately from 
the scan to see the registrar. The first thing she said to me was that I 
would probably need a CS. When I questioned this, she said I could have an 
X-ray to measure my pelvis and see if it might be possible to deliver a 
breech baby vaginally. Anyway, I made an appointment for another scan two 
weeks later. I left feeling that the registrar was already sharpening her 
knives.
</p>

<p>
&#145;At no point did anyone at the hospital say what my GP did tell me: 
that there was still plenty of time for the baby to turn by itself and that 
there was no need to worry. Nobody apart from my antenatal teacher told me 
that there might be something I could do to help the baby turn.
</p>

<p>
&#145;I spent the following two weeks crawling on all fours and lying with 
my hips higher than my head. By the date of my next scan the baby had 
turned and her head was engaged.
</p>

<p>
&#145;I don&#146;t know whether the exercises helped or if the baby would 
have turned anyway. (She was very active all along.) But it certainly made 
me feel less anxious and less helpless to have something positive to 
do.&#146;
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
If at the 36th week of pregnancy the baby is breech, there is no cause for 
alarm: it is quite probable that it will turn spontaneously before birth, 
and there are some simple steps the mother can take to encourage it to do 
so.
</p>

<p>
One technique, described in many popular guides for pregnant women, is to 
lie down on your back several times a day, for about ten minutes each time, 
with your hips slightly raised on cushions and knees flexed. This method 
may possibly be effective but has a drawback: in advanced pregnancy, lying 
on your back may be uncomfortable; more importantly, the pressure exerted 
on the vena cava may lead to dizziness and fainting and can also reduce the 
supply of oxygen to the baby.
</p>



<p>
Hofmeyr<sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup>  describes other techniques 
used to encourage a breech baby to turn inside the uterus. Among these is 
the Elkins knee&#8211;chest position, for which a high rate of success is 
claimed. Hofmeyr also reports an interesting chance observation: 
spontaneous turning occurred in several women just after they had been 
subjected to ultrasound examination to confirm breech position. He suggests 
that this may be due to the women rolling onto their hands and knees as 
they were getting off the examination table.
</p>



<p>
When I read Hofmeyr&#146;s account I was delighted, as it appeared to 
support an idea that I had developed independently. Drawing on my insights 
as a teacher of the Alexander Technique (AT), I devised a series of 
movements that combines dynamically the knee&#8211;chest position with kneeling 
on all fours. Over several years I have taught this technique at my special 
AT and movement classes for pregnant women, and my experience suggests that 
it is effective. Of course, in the absence of a scientific statistical 
study it cannot be ruled out that the cases where it seems to have worked 
were just a series of lucky turns. Proper research will be required in 
order to reach firmer conclusions. Be that as it may, most childbirth 
educators will agree that these movements have several beneficial effects 
during pregnancy and in childbirth, irrespective of the baby&#146;s 
position.
</p>

<p>
The best way to learn the procedure is under the guidance of an AT teacher. 
While performing the movements it is very important to maintain a proper 
relationship between the neck, the head and the back as well as the 
appropriate level of muscular tension. To judge this subjectively is much 
more difficult than may be imagined: our kinaesthetic sense is frequently 
deceptive after years of incorrect use. It is for this reason that the 
guidance of an AT teacher is necessary &#151; at least initially.
</p>

<p>
The AT teaches us consciously to inhibit old tense habits of movement and 
to replace them by more economical patterns based on a new self-awareness 
&#151; a new set of conscious   &#145;directions&#146; addressed by the 
mind to the body. Freeing the neck, allowing the head to go forward and up 
and the back to lengthen and widen, results in free and efficient breathing 
and in correct positioning of the other parts and organs of the body. This 
produces true relaxation. It requires learning a new body-grammar and 
allows us to discover the wisdom of the body and a new freedom for it. 
Having this freedom, the body moves with maximal balance and co-ordination 
and minimal effort.
</p>

<p>
All this should be borne in mind when reading the following description of 
the procedure. Look at the drawings but remember that they cannot convey 
the inner dynamic of movement.
</p>

<p>
If your baby is still in breech position at 36 weeks, set aside two or 
three periods of about 15&#150;20 minutes each day for the following 
sequence of movements. Prepare a clear floor surface, preferably carpeted, 
on which you can crawl unhindered. Wear loose comfortable clothes such as a 
tracksuit, and no shoes.
</p>

<p>

<ul>
    <img src="crawls1.jpg"  align="left" />
    <i>
    <li>Kneel on your hands and knees, making sure that your hands are 
    directly under your shoulders and your knees directly under your hip 
    joints. Let the whole surface of your hand touch the floor: if you 
    lean on your fingers or knuckles, you create unnecessary tension. 
    Don&#146;t curl your toes, but keep the top of your instep in contact 
    with the floor. Make sure that your head is balanced on the top of your 
    spine, so that your face is horizontal and parallel to the floor. 
    Don&#146;t hollow or arch your back, but allow it to lengthen and 
    widen.
    </li>
    </p>
    
    <!img src="crawls1.jpg"  align="left" />
    <p>
    <li>  With your head leading, prepare to crawl: take one small step 
    forward on diagonally opposite limbs (for example on your right hand 
    and left knee). At this point your weight should be evenly distributed 
    between all fours.
    </li>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <li>Now begin to crawl: allow the head to lead and move on 
    diagonally opposite limbs.  You will notice that when you start each 
    step (leading with the head) your body&#146;s weight shifts to the 
    limbs that were in front and are now stationary. After each step, your 
    weight should again be evenly distributed between all fours. Do not 
    rush. Pause. Breathe out gently through an open, soft and wet mouth. Do 
    not gasp but allow the intake of air to happen gently and effortlessly; 
    your abdominal wall and lower back will expand of their own accord.</li>
    </p>
    
    <img src="crawls2.jpg" align="left" />
    <p>
    <li>As you crawl slowly, don&#146;t lift your knee off the floor as it 
    begins to move forward but let it stay in light contact with the floor; 
    the leg will be dragged gently along the floor, pulled forward by the 
    rest of your body, until it is approximately under the hip joint. Then 
    draw it further forward to complete the step. Now your weight should 
    again be distributed evenly between all fours.</li>
    </p>
    
    
    
    <p>
    <li>As you get into a rhythm, the crawling should become a 
    smooth continuous motion. It may help you to imagine that you are being 
    pulled forward gently by the hair on the top of your head. The 
    undulating movement shifts your weight from one pair of diagonally 
    opposite limbs to the other.</li>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <li>As you continue to crawl, try varying the rhythm. The 
    movement should give you a pleasant feeling: if it doesn&#146;t feel 
    good, it probably isn&#146;t doing you much good. From time to time 
    pause, think about what you are doing  (it is not a mechanical 
    movement!), pay attention to your breathing and let your neck be 
    free.</li>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <li>After you have crawled for about ten minutes, bring yourself from 
    kneeling on all fours to the knee&#8211;chest position: lean forward 
    from your hip joints and lower your head down to the floor; spread your 
    knees slightly further apart; <img src="crawls3.jpg" align="left" /> 
    allow your elbows to bend until one cheek and both forearms rest on the 
    floor, your hands flat next to your head, and your elbows in line with 
    your shoulders, allowing your back to widen.  (You may find it more 
    comfortable if you place cushions under your knees.)</li>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <li>Rest in the knee&#8211;chest position for a few more minutes; 
    you may occasionally turn your head from side to side. Talk to your 
    baby. Then get up again on all fours and carefully rise up to standing. 
    Take care not to lock your knees.</li>
    </p>
    
    
</i></ul>

<p><br clear="left" />How might these movements help to encourage the breech baby to turn? 
Nothing can be said with certainty, but perhaps the undulation of the 
pelvis during crawling and the slope of the torso in the knee&#8211;chest 
position &#151; while the back lengthens and widens &#151; help to dislodge 
the baby&#146;s bottom from the position in which it has got stuck. 
Thereafter the baby may be freer to perform the pre-programmed turning 
reflex.
</p>

<p>
The following story illustrates several points that recur in reports of 
mothers who have used this technique.
</p>



<blockquote><p>
&#145;Having had a completely normal and relatively easy birth with my 
first child, it came as something of a shock to discover at 36 weeks that 
my second baby was firmly stuck in breech position and that the 
hospital&#146;s policy in such cases was to recommend an elective CS. While 
the consultant was keen to stress the advantages of this (absolute safety 
for the baby and less &#147;discomfort&#148; for me), he was also willing 
to support me if I wanted to try for a spontaneous vaginal delivery. 
However, the baby would be closely monitored throughout labour and signs of 
foetal distress would mean an emergency CS under general anaesthetic &#151; 
he rated my chances of achieving a &#145;normal&#146; delivery at no more 
than 50 per cent.
</p>

<p>
&#145;I went away to consider my options, slightly surprised that the 
hospital&#146;s collective obstetric wisdom could not suggest any 
strategies for trying to persuade my baby to turn. I consulted every book I 
could find on the subject, all of which suggested that breech babies could 
and did turn right up until the onset of labour. But hospital doctors, 
midwives and my GP all agreed that my baby was firmly stuck and, whether 
delivered normally or by caesarean, would remain a breech.
</p>

<p>
&#145;Even though the professionals thought it was hopeless, I knew it 
would make me feel better if I had at least tried to get the baby to turn. 
So, I spent several sessions a day lying on the floor with my pelvis raised 
on cushions. After a week or so without progress I consulted Ilana 
Machover, whose National Childbirth Trust antenatal classes I had attended 
during my first pregnancy. She immediately suggested that crawling might 
help and arranged an appointment to show me how to do it. Learning to do 
the exercise properly proved more difficult than I expected, but once I was 
crawling to Ilana&#146;s satisfaction I found it a curiously relaxing 
activity and crawled around the living room several times a day.
</p>

<p>
&#145;By this time I had little hope of anything changing but, two days 
later, as I lay in the bath before my 38 week hospital appointment, my 
stomach heaved with astonishing vigour as the baby conducted what was 
evidently a major man&#156;uvre. I didn&#146;t dare to believe that it had 
turned a full somersault but, to my delight and the total amazement of the 
consultant and all in attendance, an ultrasound scan later that morning 
revealed the baby settled in the normal position for birth.&#146;
</p></blockquote>

<p>
It is worth mentioning that Caroline Flint<sup><a 
href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>  recommends crawling, from the 36th week 
onwards, as a means of encouraging the baby to rotate into an anterior 
position. She notes however that many women ignore this advice because 
&#145;crawling is very boring&#146;. I think it can be made much more 
interesting by thinking about what one is doing and by tuning into the 
rhythm of the movement.
</p>

<p>
My own experience suggests that crawling (particularly in the manner that I 
have described) is beneficial to all pregnant women, irrespective of the 
position of the baby, because it is a good physical and mental preparation 
for the process of childbirth. (I hope to expand on this in another 
article.)
</p>

<p>
Most of the women to whom I have taught this technique report that the 
turning occurred not while they were actually going through the movements 
but later, when they were relaxed, for example (as in the story just 
quoted) when taking a bath. Do not expect your baby to turn after the first 
time you try the movements. Repeat it several times each day. Don&#146;t 
give up. The majority of breech babies will turn eventually. However, we 
must accept that a few will not, probably because they cannot:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
&#145;Having had a history of breech pregnancies in the family, it did not 
come as a surprise to me, that my baby was sitting firm on his bottom, not 
willing to turn. Around 36 weeks a CS was mentioned, which made me very 
nervous. Ilana, My NCT teacher, showed me how to do the front crawl and lie 
on the floor with my bottom raised. I found the front crawl very relaxing 
and spent a lot of my time enjoying it.
</p>

<p>
&#145;The first 28 hours of labour were spent at home. I thought if I go to 
the hospital at the last possible moment, the medical staff would have to 
give me a chance to deliver the baby naturally. As soon as we arrived at 
the hospital I was being prepared for CS, which was very discouraging and 
distressing. After a lot of discussions with the medical staff I was left 
alone to cope with this, as I wanted. Another twelve hours passed and I was 
still only few centimetres dilated. My baby was in distress &#151; a CS was 
inevitable. After the birth we learned that the umbilical cord was wrapped 
twice around my baby&#146;s neck: he didn&#146;t have a choice in 
turning!&#146;
