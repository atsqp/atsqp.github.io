</b></font><br />

There is an ongoing debate about labour pains and the use of drugs to 
alleviate or eliminate them.  It is a controversial and fundamental issue 
in childbirth, arousing strong emotions, as it involves women and their 
partners, midwives, childbirth educators and obstetricians; and concerns 
the future health of mother and baby.
</p>

<p>
One writer may describe the ill effects (such as backache lasting for over 
a year) caused by the use of epidural anaesthesia during labour.  That 
writer may condemn the conspiracy of silence that seems to exist regarding 
the negative side-effects of drugs used in our hospitals to reduce or 
eliminate the pain of contractions.  Another, arguing against the natural 
childbirth movement, may imply that birth is a medical event and therefore 
calls for the use of the latest drug technology.  Often writers who share 
the latter attitude compare childbirth to a visit to a dentist.  However, 
generally speaking birth is not a medical event unless it is made to become 
so.  Giving birth is not an illness; it is generally a normal healthy 
family event.  On a visit to the dentist, your role is to be a passive 
recipient of treatment.  Is this also the right attitude to childbirth?  Is 
labour pain a pathological symptom?
</p>

<p>
Here I&#8217;d like to take another look at the whole issue of pain-killing drugs 
in childbirth and their influence on natural birth. 

<p>
When epidural began to be used on a mass scale, it was hailed as a panacea. 
Many women hoped that they would be able to give birth safely without any 
pain.  But over the years, as the negative side-effects of epidural became 
apparent, disappointment has set in.  First we noticed that when drugs are 
used, further medical intervention often becomes necessary.  The rate of 
births involving forceps and Caesarean section has soared.  Later on, 
reports have shown that there is a link between epidural and subsequent 
backache.  I find it quite disturbing that the revelations of the survey 
<em>Health after Childbirth</em> by the University of Birmingham&#8217;s 
Medical School (HMSO, 1991) are hardly ever quoted.  This study showed 
links between health problems and some delivery procedures, notably 
epidural anaesthesia. Alas, it seems to have impressed only those of us who 
were already concerned about the consequences of these drugs.
</p>

<p>
And we have yet to mention the effects on the baby.  Short-term side 
effects are well documented.  Are there any long-term ones?  There is not 
enough research and we do not know much; but what we do know is not exactly 
good news.  A report from Sweden (<i>Acta Obstet.  Gynecol.  Scand. </i> 
67, 1988) found that among young drug addicts there was a correlation 
between the drug they preferred and the drug their mothers received in 
childbirth.  The authors suggest that this can be explained as an effect of 
imprinting.
</p>

<p>
Childbirth is a very finely-tuned involuntary process.  It is regulated by 
a series of signals exchanged between the mother&#8217;s brain and the rest 
of her body.  The contractions of the uterus are controlled by the 
secretion of appropriate hormones during each of the three phases of 
labour: dilation of the cervix, birth, and birth of the placenta.  This 
physiological&#8211;chemical process (which also has important 
psychological aspects) can easily be disrupted by any outside interference.  
It is frequently observed and well-documented that labour, at its early 
stages, may halt altogether when a woman gets emotionally perturbed.  This 
may be caused, for example, by critical whispers of her attendants, 
expressing disapproval of her state of body or mind, such as &#145;she is 
not making any progress&#146;, &#145;her attitude is wrong&#146;, &#145;she 
is fighting too much&#146;.  A similar effect may be caused by a dramatic 
change in her environment, or by the psychological pressure of other people 
around her well-wishing relatives who are impatient for the baby to be 
born.  Similarly, continuous monitoring of her progress also puts an 
enormous stress on the labouring mother.  And anxiety releases the wrong 
hormones.  Drugs can also disrupt the process by cutting off the 
body&#8217;s own feedback signalling.
</p>

<p>
The mother cannot directly control her autonomous nervous system and her 
hormonal balance.  During the first stage of labour the woman does not 
&#145;do&#146; anything to give birth: the dilation of the cervix happens 
by itself, and all she needs to &#145;do&#8217; is to allow the body to get on 
with a job that it seems to know how to do all by itself.
</p>

<p>
During labour it is very difficult for the unprepared woman to accept that 
the pain of the contractions is &#8216;normal&#8217;.  For the majority of 
women, this is the most severe pain they have ever experienced.  Our 
society does not teach us to tolerate pain and we are used to taking 
pain-killing drugs for the slightest discomfort.
<p>
<i>But pain-killing drugs may derail the natural process of birth by masking 
the body&#8217;s signals and blocking their pathways</i>. This explains why the 
use of drugs often makes further medical intervention necessary, leading to 
forceps or caesarean deliveries.  A woman asking (or accepting) pain-killing 
drugs does so to eliminate her immediate pain, unaware of the unintended 
consequences.
</p>

<p>
In order to accept labour pain as normal, we have to understand its role: 
<i>labour pain is not pathological but functional, and should therefore not 
be eliminated</i>; but a woman can be psycho-physically prepared to cope 
with it.
</p>

<p>
This is of course no easy matter, and the availability of drugs makes it 
even more difficult.  However let us recall that not so very long ago it 
was common practice for pregnant women to take a variety of drugs, ranging 
from tobacco to thalidomide.  Nowadays when the side-effects have become 
known, many pregnant women are reluctant to take even the mildest drugs. 
Education has had a great effect here.  Let us try education also in 
relation to labour pains.  Every woman can learn to use herself well, move 
in a relaxed way and stay upright during labour.  No athletic skill or 
aerobic training whatsoever is required.  We need to rid ourselves of our 
culture-induced images of labouring women lying in bed huffing and puffing, 
as well as of our habit of going to bed whenever we are in pain.
</p>

<p>
Here is where the technique developed by F M Alexander at the turn of the 
century can be of great benefit.  The Alexander Technique has long been 
known to actors and musicians, who use it to improve their performance, 
reduce stress and cope with stage fright.  It has also been very effective 
in dealing with, and preventing, many complaints common in pregnancy.  More 
recently Alexander teachers have been working alongside medical staff in 
chronic pain clinics.  The Alexander Technique teaches us consciously to 
inhibit old tense habits of movement and to replace them by more economical 
patterns based on self-awareness×a new set of &#8216;directions&#8217; 
addressed by the brain to the body.  By freeing the neck, allowing the head 
to go forward and up and the back to lengthen and widen, we achieve free 
and efficient breathing and correct positioning of the other parts and 
organs of the body.  We learn a new body-grammar and discover the wisdom of 
the body and an unaccustomed freedom for it.  Having this freedom, we move 
with maximal balance and coordination and minimal effort.  My experience as 
an Alexander teacher and a childbirth educator shows that the same 
principles can be applied to pregnancy and the labour process itself.  
Rather than trying to eliminate labour pains altogether, we can learn to 
cope with them.
</p>

<p>
Where water-birth is available, women are advised not to go into the pool 
early in labour, because experience has shown us that this may arrest the 
process.  The woman must wait until her cervix is dilated to about 5cm. 
This stage of early labour can be very difficult.  Sometimes it drags on 
for many hours or even a few days; meanwhile you may experience severe 
labour pains.  The Alexander Technique can teach women to cope with early 
labour pain rather than wear themselves out fighting against it, thinking 
negative thoughts and wait impatiently for the time when it is advisable to 
enter the pool for relief.
</p>

<p>
Women wanting an epidural often complain that they were made to feel guilty 
about it.  Similarly, anti-smoking propaganda may perhaps cause a lot of 
guilt feelings in those who find it difficult to quit.  But this is no 
reason to advocate a tolerant attitude to smoking; and the fact that 
smokers find smoking pleasant does not mean that we ought to recommend it. 
If the available evidence shows that the drugs presently used in labour can 
have severe negative side-effects, then it is our duty to let women know 
this.  We have to find other ways of dealing with the problem of guilt 
feelings in those women who accept drugs.
</p>

<p>
If the idea of natural childbirth appeals to you, you need to prepare 
yourself seriously.  The contrary pressure in a modern 
technology-dominated hospital is hard to resist without strong commitment 
and due physical and mental preparation.
</p>

<p>
I hope that this article will provide you with a feasible route to 
realizing your choice.
